## Welcome to Maze Benchmark

This web page contains the supplementary material of the paper titled "Maze Benchmark for Evolutionary Algorithms". In this site you can download the dataset and the Software used. In addition, you're going to find the user guide for this material.

I want to welcome you, and I hope you found this material useful.

## Dataset

The `dataset` folder contains the maze sets generated for testing Evolutionary Algorithms. This folder has two folders which match with the two proposed benchmark problems. These problems are the "Similarly Connected Maze Problem" (folder `SCMP`), and the "Differently Connected Maze Problem" (folder `DCMP`).

### SCMP Folder

In the `SCMP` folder there is four folders which contain the four generated instances of the SCMP problem. Each folder has a file called `starting_locations.loc`, and a folder called `mazes` where there are 10 maze files (.mz) generated with the connectivities shown in the following table:

**Folder** | **Connectivity**|
-------|-------------|
`SCMP1`|      0%     |
`SCMP2`|     30%     |
`SCMP3`|     60%     |
`SCMP2`|    100%     |

Additionally, in SCMP folders there is also the folder `images`, where there are images of the mazes inside folder `mazes`. Feel free to use and modify these images as you want in your research.
